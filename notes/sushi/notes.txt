* I need to figure out how I can optimize ui's update
* only do ui tree walking when we need to, if ever
* I was going to make an example for making a custom item for ui, but I don't like how much there is to it
  I need to find a better way to uniquely identify these things, there HAS To be a way
  
 * In suugu, I've added a way to represent units that I'm happy with so far, but I'm not sure how to approach
   metric prefixes and a bunch of other things still
